name=Cartographic Line Generalization
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Simplify and smooth lines for given map scale.
about=Algorithm gives lines on map with good geometrical and visual properties.
      The generalization combines simplification followed by smoothing.
      Generalization algorithms in this plugin are based on area preserving approach. This simulates manual generalization, and parameters of the algorithms were defined by analyzing manually generalized lines in different scales.
